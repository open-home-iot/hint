# HOME-interface
[![Build](https://github.com/megacorpincorporated/hint/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/megacorpincorporated/hint/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is the cloud part of the HOME project, a home automation open source 
initiative. The project consists of a frontend and backend part. The backend 
is based on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, frontend 
uses [Angular](https://angular.io/). Part of the HOME cloud is also a 
central [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) broker to mediate messages 
sent from [hubs](https://github.com/open-home-iot/hume) part of the 
HOME network. To manage frontend websocket topic updates,
[Redis](https://redis.io/) is used as a backend to dispatch websocket events to
consumers.

## Python
This project currently uses Python `3.9.2`. Install all dependencies from 
the project `requirements.txt`.

### Tips
Use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your Python versions.

Use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to manage project Python dependencies.

## NodeJS
Currently used NodeJS version is `14.16.1`.

### Tips
Use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your NodeJS versions.

## Development
Here follows some instructions to start development on the HINT project. 
This section consists of getting RabbitMQ, Redis, Django, and Angular up and 
running so that code changes trigger reloads that are useable directly.

### Backend
Serve the Django project as you would with any other Django project: `.
/manage.py runserver`.

#### Create local settings
Django settings are managed through a set of base settings 
`backend/settings/base.py` and local user settings. Local settings override 
the base settings.

In order to create local user settings, create a `local.py` file under 
`backend/settings/` and insert the following:

```
from .base import *  # noqa


HUME_BROKER_USERNAME = <Central RabbitMQ Username>
HUME_BROKER_PASSWORD = <Central RabbitMQ Password>

HUME_BROKER_IP = <Central RabbitMQ IP>
HUME_BROKER_PORT = <Central RabbitMQ Port>

MASTER_COMMAND_QUEUE_NAME = "hint_master"  # Or another queue name of your choosing
```
`local.py` should be updated whenever you need custom settings to your 
local environment. For example, if a custom SQL database is to be used 
locally. Any settings that should be shared must be stated in `base.py` as 
`local.py` is not under version control.

#### RabbitMQ
HINT requires a RabbitMQ instance that it can listen to messages from hubs 
on. Make sure the address and port of the RabbitMQ instance correspond to 
the `HUME_BROKER_IP` and `HUME_BROKER_PORT` settings, as well as the 
`HUME_BROKER_USERNAME` and `HUME_BROKER_PASSWORD` shall correspond to a 
user with sufficient rights to create a message queue. 
`MASTER_COMMAND_QUEUE_NAME` is customizeable, but ensure it corresponds to 
the queue name where HOME hubs will post messages.

#### Redis
Redis is used to enable pub/sub for websocket frontend updates, to update 
users in real time of hub events. By default, HINT expects a local Redis 
instance running on port `6379`.

#### Database
By default, HINT uses SQLite for development purposes. Other SQL databases 
can be used just as well. Override Django settings in your `local.py` file 
if you want to use something else. 

### Frontend

#### Angular
Install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) through
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It's useful for creating new components etc. 
Install all dependencies from the frontend `package-lock.json` as with any 
other NodeJS project. Use the Angular CLI to update project dependencies.

#### Watch for file changes
Issue `ng build --watch --output-path=<path-to-hint>/backend/static/ang/` 
to compile the frontend project to get served by the Django development 
server. The command will make sure the compiled JS files get served from a 
known Django static directory.
